# Check My Mushrooms
_An interactive mushroom classification app_

This project develops an interactive app for predicting a mushroom's edibility, based on its physical attributes. (**Note: This app is a toy and not to be used in real life. Consult an expert before consuming any wild mushrooms.**)

In this repo you will find:

* **mushrooms.ipynb**: Jupyter notebook containing project code
* **mushrooms.csv**: CSV file containing training data

The dataset comes originally from UCI, but I acquired [a version of UCI's datasett on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/mushroom-classification).

This is a work in progress. Check back for updates.
